# Abstract Vault

Web3 is an emerging field and can solve a variety of problems faced by the society but currently, there are a lot of touchpoints from user wanting to create a wallet to their first transaction. It's generally difficult for a layman to execute all the steps correctly. Wallets, today require user to:
- remember seed phrase
- never recover the account without seed phrase
- go to a CEX and buy some cryptocurrency for gas payment
- hold the native currency even if the d-app doesn't need it

These problems occur because of the inherent architecture of Ethereum and other EVM chains which requires a private key associated with an EOA. To solve this, a number of proposals were placed, the most famous being the EIP4337. Our project, is based on this EIP and allows user to have a seamless experience. It involves abstract accounts, or smart contract based wallets.
